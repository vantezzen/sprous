After forgetting your password you have two possibilities:

### 1. You still have access to the account

This could be the case if you have forgot your password but are still logged in on another device.

In this case, simply go to [https://example.com/settings/security/password/](https://example.com/settings/security/password/) and reset your password.

### 2. You still have access to the mail address

In this case, please visit [https://example.com/login](https://example.com/login) and click `Reset Password`.

### 3. You don't have access to the mail address

In this case please [contact out support team](https://example.com/support). We will try to verify that it is you and reset your password for you.
